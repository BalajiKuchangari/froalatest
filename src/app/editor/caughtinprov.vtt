Good morning, sir. Good morning. The charge was speeding, sir. Have you been driving for three years?

7
00:00:07.00.000 --> 00:00:21.00.000
No, I've not been driving in the U.S. for three years, but I've been driving in Africa before the U .S., so I just got my U.S. license like six months ago.

00:00:21.00.000 --> 00:00:24.00.000
Oh, you celebrate it by speeding.

11
00:00:24.00.000 --> 00:00:58.00.000
No, I didn't see no speed sign on Harris Avenue. And that was the way from Harris to Providence Place, like towards Providence Place Mall. I didn't see no sign. So I thought that was like 30, the speed limits and something like that. But when the cop stopped me, he told me that the speed limit was 25. And then he gave me a ticket and told me that I was driving 35. So, but he brought a 38 on the ticket.

13
00:00:58.00.000 --> 00:01:00.00.000
No, he wrote 35.

15
00:01:00.00.000 --> 00:01:01.00.000
Oh.

17
00:01:01.00.000 --> 00:01:02.00.000
Oh, OK.
